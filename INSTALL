To set these up as your very own bashrc and vimrc files:

Check out to home directory as rc-files (or your choice of directory name)

cd $HOME
ln -s rc-files/.*rc .

You probably don't want to do this unless you're me, or you want my exact 
setup and don't have your own rc files already.

Otherwise best to pick and choose lines you may find useful.
