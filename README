These are my vim and bash setups.

I keep them here so I can easily set up new machines with my preferred setup. I don't know if it's useful to anyone but me.

Set up as follows. I advise reading setup.sh before you do this. It does stuff I want, it may not do stuff you want.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:helenst/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles/
./setup.sh
```
